                            <p>This is because not all events are relevant, especially worldwide. A local event with 8 participants is decidedly insignificant for the purpose of this site, which is to give the possibility to analyze the destination in a more or less extended way. So only the administrators will take care to insert the most relevant events for this objective. in general with the participation of more than 32 people and with a medium-high competitive level, let's say from the 3rd level of the CR.</p>
                            <p>But if you know of an interesting event, you can let the administrators know by sending an email to the following address: <a href="mailto:fowdeckhub@altervista.org">fowdeckhub@altervista.org</a>. Every contribution can be fundamental!</p>

                            <p>The ruler breakdown chart shows how the sovereigns are distributed throughout the event, shows the king preferred by the players and the less, giving an idea of what will then be an eventual top.</p>

							<p>But eye to appearances! So much variety of sovereigns in this chart will not necessarily mean that the goal is also varied. In a future it will also be implemented the graph of the distribution of the various types of deck used during the competition, giving a slightly more real idea of the state of the goal.</p>

							<p>See the appropriate question about which indicators of a varied and balanced destination are adopted by the developers about it!</p>
